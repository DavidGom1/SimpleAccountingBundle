# Simple Accounting Bundle for Kimai

A Kimai plugin that adds a "Simple Accounting" layer to your projects. It allows you to track "Accumulated" (billable hours), "Invoiced" (exported to Kimai), and "Simple Entries" (manual payments/adjustments) to calculate the **Real Remaining Balance**.

## Features

- **Project Dashboard**: A clean list view of all your accounting projects.
- **Detailed Project View**:
  - **Stats Cards**: Quickly see Accumulated, Invoiced, Simple Payments, and Real Remaining amounts.
  - **Simple Entries**: Add manual positive or negative entries (e.g., partial payments, extra costs, refunds).
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in English and Spanish.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile.
